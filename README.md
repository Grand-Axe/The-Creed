# The Creed
This is the first iteration of a code of ethics (owned by YOU) to guide humanity in its quest for artificial intelligence. So far, the pursuit has been dangerously uncontrolled, with potential for sleepwalking into serious danger, even if unintended by artificial intelligence creators. 

For the sake of a safer, better world, this code belongs to you, to debate, amend, adopt and enforce.

## To Do
+ Create local documents to hold definitions, instead of the current Wikipedia references which are inadequate for the purpose.
+ Create article explaining rationale for each item in The Creed.

## My Personal Interest
I am deeply involved in the creation of artificial intelligence, so can see first hand, both its potential for immense good (when handled right) and its potential for immense evil if handled irresponsibly.
